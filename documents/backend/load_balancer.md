What are the common load-balancing algorithms?

The diagram below shows 6 common algorithms.
ðŸ”¹ Static Algorithms
1. Round robin
The client requests are sent to different service instances in sequential order. The services are usually required to be stateless.

2. Sticky round-robin
This is an improvement of the round-robin algorithm. If Aliceâ€™s first request goes to service A, the following requests go to service A as well.

3. Weighted round-robin
The admin can specify the weight for each service. The ones with a higher weight handle more requests than others.

4. Hash
This algorithm applies a hash function on the incoming requestsâ€™ IP or URL. The requests are routed to relevant instances based on the hash function result.

ðŸ”¹ Dynamic Algorithms
5. Least connections
A new request is sent to the service instance with the least concurrent connections.

6. Least response time
A new request is sent to the service instance with the fastest response time.
